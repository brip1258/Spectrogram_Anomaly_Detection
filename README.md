# ROAD_anomaly_detection

## Report
### Data Exploration:
    For my data exploration, I started by evaluating the ROAD_dataset.h5 file overall, be exploring the structure of the file. I created functions that would evaluated each grouping and what was represented within the groups. I was able to identify that there were 10 anomaly data groupings with varying number of observations ranging from 56 (Oscillating Tiles) to 550 (Galactic Plane), showing us that we have imbalance in labeled data. I was also, able to see the representation of the train and test data, where the first thing that jumped out was that we did not have any labeled data for both. This led me to the conclusion that we would be utilizing a method in semi-supervised learning. I wanted to dive deeper into the representation of the vectors within the data frame leading me to create correlation plots. From the vectors you could see there there certain representations that were common amongst each group of anomalies. Based on the background information from the paper and the data source page, it's evident that these observations should not be grouped together due to the high dimensionality and variability, as well as auto-correlation being used to simplify the data, reducing the size without losing essential features. It's because of this that aggregating the values was not necessarily explored more in feature engineering.
